						<p>Welcome, to the poor funding information page!</p><br>

							<p>Bangladesh is a developing country with a population of 156.6 million. Although private universities and private education systems are plentiful in Bangladesh, there is also the need for poor funding in those universities to allow educational facilities to poor and talented population. This will lead to the production of a healthy and prosperous nation and lead to the welfare to our developing country.</p><br>

							<p>With respect to such particularly worthy factors the University of SIU has allowed poor funding for students whose families are sufferers of extreme poverty. There is even the allowance of educational fee reduction to even 20%. This has highly benefited a large number of students from poor families who are extraordinarily talented, to get the chance of higher education in their subject of choice and ensured their bright future.</p><br>

							<p>Any student who is interested and is in need for a poor fund help is requested to notify and contact the university authority to get the allowances that may be waiting to facilitate his or her higher education.</p><br>
