Plenty of open spaces are available in the campus for the students to move about for rest and recreation. Construction of other floors (five floors in all) will be completed soon. At present, two separate buildings for female students are being used as hostels near the university. <br /><br />
						<h2>Foreign Academic and Technical Collaborations</h2>
							With increasing internationalization of education and more at the university levels, there is a strong compulsion to promote interaction, especially with institutions of higher education in the industrial countries. Such interaction provides access to ever changing scenario of modern education delivery system and most up-to-date innovative development in teaching and learning methodology. Recognizing this to be imperative, SIU has already initiated a number of collaborative programs with universities in the USA, Australia, Canada and UK.
