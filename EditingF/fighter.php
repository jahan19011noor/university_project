						<p>Welcome, to the children of our Freedom Fighters!</p><br />
						<p>Our country of Bangladesh and our Independence is the hard earn that we have got through the deaths and sacrifices of our Freedom Fighters in the War for Freedom in 1971. During the 9 months war with Pakistan many of our Freedom Fighters have sacrificed their lives to get the freedom that we have today. We are proud to say that we are an Independent nation and our Independence has been achieved through the sacrifice of our freedom fighters.</p><br />
						<p>The Sylhet International University has allowed 50% fees reduction for the children of our Freedom Fighters in order to pay the debt that we have towards them. This is as due respect for them and to allow the better education of their children and as a reasonable pride for our Independence achievement.</p><br />
						<p>All the children of Freedom Fighters are requested with due respect to allow the university authority to know about them as being so born. So the allowance will be offered with honor to show respect to the great sacrifice of their father.</p><br />
